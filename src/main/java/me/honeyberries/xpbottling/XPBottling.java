/**
 * A lightweight Bukkit plugin that lets players bottle their experience.
 * <p>
 * Core behavior:
 * - When a player right-clicks an enchanting table with a glass bottle (main hand),
 *   consume a fixed amount of experience and give back one experience bottle.
 * - The action requires a specific permission and provides feedback via chat messages and sound.
 * <p>
 * Permissions:
 * - xpbottling.use â€” required to perform the bottling action.
 * <p>
 * Notes:
 * - The interaction event is canceled to prevent the enchanting table UI from opening.
 * - Experience is removed using the same cost value that is granted to the bottle.
 * - Feedback messages are sent using Adventure Components.
